{"code": 425, "name": "Too Early", "message": "A 425 (Too Early) status code indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed. User agents that send a request in early data are expected to retry the request when receiving a 425 (Too Early) response status code. A user agent SHOULD retry automatically, but any retries MUST NOT be sent in early data."}
