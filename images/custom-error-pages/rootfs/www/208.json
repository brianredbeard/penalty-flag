{"code": 208, "name": "Already Reported", "message": "The 208 (Already Reported) status code can be used inside a DAV: propstat response element to avoid enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection repeatedly. For each binding to a collection inside the request's scope, only one will be reported with a 200 status, while subsequent DAV:response elements for all other bindings will use the 208 status, and no DAV:response elements for their descendants are included."}
